# mio-websocket

This is a WebSocket library for Rust, based on [*mio*](https://github.com/carllerche/mio) event loop.

It's under development for now, so please *don't* use it on production. It's started as a tutorial project, and the initial design and the development process are described in series of blog posts, "[Rust in Detail](http://nbaksalyar.github.io/2015/07/10/writing-chat-in-rust.html)". The end goal is to develop a high quality WebSocket server and client library based on the event loop (though not exposed in the interface).
